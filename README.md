# Up To Eleven

A Web Extension that inserts a Web Audio API `GainNode` and `DynamicsCompressor`
node to improve the audio of videos that are too quiet.

This is a proof of concept: the input gain to the compressor is fixed, and the
compressor parameters are fixed as well.

- Chrome: It works but I haven't bothered uploading it to their site, let me know
if anybody is interested
